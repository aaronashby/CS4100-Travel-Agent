# CS4100-Travel-Agent

Have you ever had to research what the weather will be like the week before your vacation? Did you also do itinerary planning last minute? This application might be the one for you! Our idea is to program a travel agent that would give the ability to see what type of clothes to pack based on the weather and location the user is traveling to. We were thinking of generating a packing list or the types of clothes that the user should bring during the trip whether it might snow, rain, be hot, etc. We would suggest the type of clothes to wear such as either light or heavy clothes. The user would also have the ability to make the packing list themselves and add/drop. We would also like the ability to make packing lists for multiple people if you are going on the same trip with other people. We were thinking of using a Weather API for the weather and Aviationstack for flight data. Using flight data, we could incorporate/consider if there is a weight limit for the luggage or see different pricing for different airlines. We would also like to incorporate the ability to generate nearby attractions to do based on the weather. The user would put in their hotel destination and based on the A* Algorithm, it could generate nearby attractions to go to, keeping in mind the weather as well.
